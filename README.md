## Abstract

[Back to navigation](#go-to)

*Disclaimer: Of course, these techniques can be used by a small group of extremists, the same as any kind of knowledge, tech, money, and infrastructure can be used by criminals. However, this guide is focused on techniques that provide good results only if the movement is supported by the majority of people through active participation, financial donations, and engagement on social media.*

Democracy is in danger across the world. Global warming is accelerating. Human and animal rights are abused on a massive scale. Only global solidarity and unite of people across the world can bring us a better future. Decentralized movements proved to be more resilient, so in this manual we will provide step by step instructions how to organize a sustainable decentralized movement.

All tactics and techniques listed below are based on a real-life experience of highly decentralized movements such as:

* Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement
* Catalonia’s pro-independence movement
* Cryptocurrency movement


## Idea

[Back to navigation](#go-to)

*”The movement is only successful if starts with an idea that is strong enough to take root in the mind of population and inspire and motivate people to spread it.”* - [Revolution: An Instruction Manual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zq4f6WYmHU)

Such an idea should follow 3 requirements:
1. Clearly defined common interest.
2. A clear vision of what you are working towards.
3. A plan of action.

Examples:

During HK pro-democracy protests of 2019 people had 5 clear demands with an end goal of full democracy, which should be achieved via implementation of universal suffrage.

The cryptocurrency movement has an end goal of destroying government’s monopoly on money creation to make sure that corrupt governments cannot simply print money to fund programs without consent of citizens (e.g., fund wars or bail out bankers).

## Governance

[Back to navigation](#go-to)

A successful decentralized movement should have online forums where people can:

- Organize actions
- Discuss strategies
- Share information

Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram don’t suit the purpose, because exposure of the content on these platforms depends on the number of followers the author has. That means that well-established accounts will have much higher influence on the movement.

In a highly decentralized movement the decision-making process is very democratic, because any individual can propose an idea using a throw-away account and get a high level of exposure. In other words, exposure of each post or comment should depend on the content of that message, and not on the popularity of its author.

Examples:

## Web Ecosystem

[Back to navigation](#go-to)

A highly developed web ecosystem is extremely important for a successful decentralized movement, but we should understand that the system will become useless if the government shuts down an internet in the whole country as it happened in Iran during 2019 protests.

Here are the main purposes that websites and apps should facilitate:

- Decentralized governance
- Public discussions
- Sharing information
- News distribution
- Onboarding new activists
- Education of new activists
- Private communication
- On-the-ground communication
- Crowdfunding
- Storage of photos/videos
- Maps for boycott campaigns
- Maps to track police movements

If there is a lack of resources to develop specialized tools, then all-in-one platforms can be used. For example, a Reddit-like online forum [LIHKG](https://lihkg.com/) has been used during HK protests as a tool for decentralized governance, public discussions, sharing information, and sometimes for onboarding and education of new activists.

## Operations Security

[Back to navigation](#go-to)

Since decentralized movements use public forums for decision making process, an adversary (e.g., an authoritarian government) can eavesdrop on most of the communication, so operations security (OPSEC) should be focused on hiding an involvement of single individuals into the movement.
