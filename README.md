## Abstract

[Navigation](#go-to)

*Disclaimer: Of course, these techniques can be used by a small group of extremists, the same as any kind of knowledge, tech, money, and infrastructure can be used by criminals. However, this guide is focused on techniques that provide good results only if the movement is supported by the majority of people through active participation, financial donations, and engagement on social media.*

Democracy is in danger across the world. Global warming is accelerating. Human and animal rights are abused on a massive scale. Only global solidarity and unite of people across the world can bring us a better future. Decentralized movements proved to be more resilient, so in this manual we will provide step by step instructions how to organize a sustainable decentralized movement.

All tactics and techniques listed below are based on a real-life experience of highly decentralized movements such as:

* Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement
* Catalonia’s pro-independence movement
* Cryptocurrency movement


## Idea

*The movement is only successful if starts with an idea that is strong enough to take root in the mind of population and inspires and motivates people to spread it.* - [Revolution: An Instruction Manual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zq4f6WYmHU)

Such an idea should follow 3 requirements:
1. Clearly defined common interest.
2. A clear vision of what you are working towards.
3. A plan of action.

Examples:

During HK pro-democracy protests of 2019 people had 5 clear demands with an end goal of full democracy, which should be achieved via implementation of universal suffrage.

The cryptocurrency movement has an end goal of destroying government’s monopoly on money creation to make sure that corrupt governments cannot simply print money to fund programs without consent of citizens (e.g., fund wars or bail out bankers).

## Governance

A successful decentralized movement should use online forums where people can:

- Organize actions
- Discuss strategies
- Share information

Examples:

HK pro-democracy protests of 2019: [LIHKG](https://lihkg.com/), [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/HongKong), [Pincong](https://pincong.rocks/).

Cryptocurrency community: [Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency).


## Web Ecosystem

Here are the main purposes that websites and apps should facilitate:

- Decentralized governance
- Public discussions
- Sharing information
- Onboarding new activists
- Education of new activists
- Private communication
- On-the-ground communication
- Crowdfunding
- Storage of photos/videos
- Maps for boycott campaigns
- Maps to track police movements

If there is a lack of resources to develop specialized tools, then all-in-one platforms can be used. For example, an online forum LIHKG  has been used during HK protests as a tool for decentralized governance, public discussions, sharing information, and sometimes for onboarding and education of new activists.

## Operations Security

Since decentralized movements use public forums for decision making process, an adversary (e.g., an authoritarian government) can eavesdrop on most of the communication, so operations security (OPSEC) should be focused on hiding an involvement of single individuals into the movement.
